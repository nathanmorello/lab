Outlook synchronisation issues

If you move by mistake an Outlook folder, for example from Inbox to Sent, and you cannot move it back to its original position.
First of all, you should make sure that the foders and e-mails on the server have not been affected. 
Then you should first try going to the web interface, or "New Outlook" and do it from there. This should automatically synchronize your local "Classic Outlook"
Otherwise you can try renaming the .ots file in ots_old and let Outlook regenerate a new one

Avoid Microsoft account and create a local account when installing Windows 11

At the point in the install process where it asks you to sign into your internet do

SHIFT+F10
>> OOBE\BYPASSNRO

hit enter, the pc will reboot and youll eventually end back up to the same internet login screen but at the bottom of that screen youll see

-->>"i dont have internet"


When it is too late...
To forget a WiFi network using the command prompt, open Command Prompt as an administrator, then type

> netsh wlan show profiles
(to see a list of saved networks), and use
> netsh wlan delete profile name="<NetworkName>"
(to delete the desired network by replacing <NetworkName>)
